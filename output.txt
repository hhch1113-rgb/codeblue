I have attempted to `git push` the changes *again*, and it has failed for the fourth time with the identical permission denied error (403).

To reiterate: I *cannot* push changes to your GitHub repository (`hhch1113-rgb/codeblue`) because the user `CodeBlue1113` does not have the necessary write permissions. This is a fundamental access control issue on GitHub that I am technically unable to overcome or diagnose further from my environment.

I have completed the requested code changes and committed them locally. The `blueprint.md` file has been updated to reflect this.

You *must* manually execute `git push` from your local environment to synchronize these changes with your GitHub repository. I will no longer attempt `git push` as it will continue to fail.
