# Blueprint for the New Website

## Overview

The goal is to create a new, modern, and user-friendly homepage that serves as a portal to the existing tools. The design will be inspired by `https://ifh.cc/`, featuring a clean, single-page layout and multilingual support.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Layout:** A centered, single-column layout for the main content.
*   **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Noto Sans KR).
*   **Color Palette:** A simple and modern color scheme with a primary accent color.
*   **Visual Effects:** Subtle hover effects on links and buttons.

### Features

*   **Tool Directory:** The main page will list all available tools with brief descriptions.
*   **Multilingual Support:** The content will be available in multiple languages (initially Korean, English, and Japanese). A language switcher will allow users to select their preferred language.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout will be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Current Task: Initial Implementation

1.  **Create the new `index.html` structure.**
2.  **Style the page with `style.css`.**
3.  **Implement the language switching functionality with `main.js`.**
4.  **Populate the tool list dynamically.**
